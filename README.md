# Learning to Code - My Weather App 2021
This is my very own weather app produced for the SheCodesPlus course.

This weather forecast single page app utilizes an API to extract weather data and display a multi-day forecast for the selected location.

Languages Used:

- JavaScript
- HTML5/CSS3

App features:

- Requests and processes OpenWeatherMap API's data to present: 
  - Current temperature & weather description
  - 5-day forecast including min. and max. daily temperatures
  - Other weather info eg. Humidity, precipitation, & wind speed
- Retrieves geolocation weather via a button
- Ability to toggle between celsius and fahrenheit

My weather app is hosted on Netlify and can be viewed <a href="https://zen-bhaskara-aec7cb.netlify.app/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
